            <p>Hi! My name is Elliot and I am a Full-Stack Developer. I have a Front-End Nano-Degree from Udacity and am currently taking the University of Texas Full-Stack Developer Program. I decided to up my skills after I fell in love with coding two years ago.</p>
            <p>Before this, I had studied in France at the Université de Blaise Pascal and at the University of Texas in El Paso. I also did a year exchange program in The Hague, Netherlands. I love to travel and expreience new cultures! This has really helped me in my new coding life as I am used to living outside of the comfort zone and always being pushed to learn.</p>
            <p>I also have 8 years experience working in international business. I was doing Purchasing and Planning between global locations. I was even given the oppurtunity to transfer with my company as a local employee from Texas to Norway. It was a beautiful country, but I decided to move back to Texas so I could warm up.</p>
